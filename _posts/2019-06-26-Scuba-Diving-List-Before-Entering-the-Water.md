# List of Things to Do Before Scuba Diving!

## 1. Grab All Your Equipment Such as:

  #### -Mask

   It will need to be the kind that covers your nose. Look to the image for a basis of what the mask should look like. This mask needs to fit, which you can tell by placing the mask on one's face, without using the strap, and breath in. If the mask stays and you feel no air escaping after you finish breathing in, then the mask should fit well.

  #### -Fins
  There are two different types of fins used for scuba diving. One is called open heal where you wear boots with them so they have an open back. See first image below. The second type of fin is called a closed heal, where you do not wear boots with them, so therefore the heal is closed and they fit tightly around your foot. See second image below.

  #### -Snorkel
  Oddly enough you need a snorkel for if you need to stay on the surface to conserve air but still want to see what's below.

  #### -Tank
  There are two different types of scuba tanks, aluminum and steel, which are mainly a personal preference. There are also different sizes and maximum pressure amounts that you can choose.

  #### -Dive computer/pressure gauge/compass, regulator and octopus
  These are by far the most important parts to scuba diving because these are the main instruments that help you breathe. They are all attached, as seen below, by high pressure hoses that attach to the tank. The regulator, helps you breathe and the octopus is a backup regulator, for if you or your dive buddy are out of air, this will hopefully give you or them enough air to swim to the surface safely. Your dive computer is how you know the depth, time, no fly limit and for some, how much air pressure is still in your tank. If your computer does not do this, then your pressure gauge will tell you They can also have a compass which is very important for underwater navigation.

  #### -BCD (buoyancy compensator device)
  This helps you keep your buoyancy neutral while underwater and positive when you are at the surface.

  #### -Wetsuit/boots/gloves/hood
  Based on the temperature of the water will decide on the thickness that you need for your boots, gloves, hood and wetsuit to be. The colder the water the thicker the material should be.

# 2. Take you regulator setup and your BCD and attach them to your tanks


  -Make sure that your regulator is secured tightly to the top of the tank by screwing it on tightly. You then attach your BCD to the regulator attachment, which is a hose.

  -Turn the air on slowly to allow the hoses to fill but not explode.

  -Once the air is on and you hear no leaks, lay your tank down so that it won't roll away.

# 3. Putting on your gear.

  -First you need to put on your wetsuit, hood (which should be tucked in around your neck underneath the suit), gloves and boots.

  -Once those are on, you will have someone help you to put your BCD on (while they hold the tank) and strap/clip yourself in.

  -Walk to the water safely, with your mask, snorkel, and fins.

  -Do a Buddy Check of ABCDE.

  A=air              (check to make sure that air is on for you and buddy by both breathing off your regulators and watching the pressure gauge.)

  B=BCD            (make sure that your BCD is fully inflated)

  C=Computer       (Turn on/make sure your dive computer is working)

  D=Dive Equipment (Spit in mask, clean it in water to defog and then put mask on. Put fins on in water and hold onto your dive buddy so you don't fall. Make sure straps are super tight)

  E=Enter the Water
