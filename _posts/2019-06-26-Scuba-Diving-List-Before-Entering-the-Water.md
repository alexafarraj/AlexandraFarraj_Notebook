#List of Things to Do Before Scuba Diving!

##1. Grab All Your Equipment Such as:

   -Mask 
   	-It will need to be the kind that covers your nose. Look to the image for a basis of what the mask should look like. This mask needs to fit, which you can tell by placing the mask on one's face, without using the strap, and breath in. If the mask stays and you feel no air escaping after you finish breathing in, then the mask should fit well.

   -Fins 
  	 -There are two different types of fins used for scuba diving. One is called open heal where you wear boots with them so they have an open back. See first image below. The second type of fin is called full foot, where you do not wear boots with them, so therefore the heal is closed and they fit tightly around your foot. See second image below.

    -Snorkel
    	-Oddly enough you need a snorkel for if you need to stay on the surface to conserve air but still want to see what's below.

    -Tank
    	-There are two different types of scuba tanks, aluminum and steel, which are mainly a personal preference. There are also different sizes and maximum pressure amounts that you can choose.

    -Dive computer/pressure gauge/compass, regulator and octopus
       -These are by far the most important parts to scuba diving because these are the main instruments that help you breathe. They are all attached, as seen below, by high pressure hoses that attach to the tank. The regulator, helps you breathe and the octopus is a backup regulator, for if you or your dive buddy are out of air, this will hopefully give you or them enough air to swim to the surface safely. Your dive computer is how you know the depth, time, no fly limit and for some, how much air pressure is still in your tank. If your computer does not do this, then your pressure gauge will tell you They can also have a compass which is very important for underwater navigation.
